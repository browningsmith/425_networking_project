Packet format:
For the packet we decided since there are multiple fields to fill to use a struct
to help keep track of the bit offset of each of our variables. Our struct has three
members: uint32_t type, uint32_t length, and void* payload. the type and length
compromise our effective header with the type being 0 for a heartbeat message and !=0
for a data one. The length var is simply the length of the following payload and the
payload is stored as a pointer to the payload itself.

Protocol between sproxy and cproxy:
for the message relays with telnet each proxy has methods that pack and unpack messages
for sending/recieving with the respective telnet session as the packet format is only
for communication between the proxies. for the heartbeat messages we have those sent out
every 1 second using select() and when a message is recieved if it has a type == 0 it is
counted as a heartbeat and the proxy calls gettimeofday to update a global variable of the
time it last recieved a heartbeat message which is used if select returns 0 to compare
against the current time (using gettimeofday() again) to see if three seconds have passed
without recieving a heartbeat. If that is the case it closes the client socket and returns
to an outer while(1) loop to look for connecting clients again. Once it finds a client again
it checks the hearbeat payload to see if the sessionID is the same as the last it had to
decide whether it needs to create a new telnet daemon session or not. 

extra credit:
Since this assignment took longer to implement than we initial thought we did not 
do extra credit.

project working?
As far as we have tested everything should be in working order.
